>Have you ever failed an exam? What were the reasons failing?
	-Yes. I have failed an exam since I was in Prep B because I am lazy to study and I was discouraged to study because I didn't have friends. When I was in highschool, I always had a mental block and that is the worst part of having one because during exam I forgot the answers in the exam.

>For those who haven't failed an exam, what was your highest score in an exam? What do you think made you reach the top?
	-I have failed an exam and for know the highest score that I got is 60/60 which is a 100% in Public Speaking written test and it never happened again.

>How was your first experience of CSB Midterm Examinations? Knowing what you know now, what would have you done differently? What are you going to do again for the CSB Finals?
	-My first experience of the CSB Midterm Examination is normal because during highschool we always had longtests and it is always identification that is why its just a normal thing for me. In our school we have 4 Quarters and in 1 Quarter we sometimes have 5 long tests in 1 subject and it is hard. Yes. I would have done differently. I will have a time managemnet for my studies so that I would have a higher grade.
