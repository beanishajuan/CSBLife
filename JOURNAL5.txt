Saturday

It's Saturday! :D
Time to rest! 
NOOOOOOOTTTT!

For my classmates, for them its time to rest but for me I still have to go school for me to train with the pep squad.
For me, Saturdays are my morning rest day and nights and training time. I'm lucky if we don't have training but it rarely happens.
This day, I had a stomache. It was so bad that I also had a fever and my had hurts so bad.
I woke up in the middle of the night and 3:00 am and force myself to sleep because my mind keeps making ghosts and I hate ghosts.

What have I realized?

Ghosts don't exist and they can't hurt you because they are just souls.
