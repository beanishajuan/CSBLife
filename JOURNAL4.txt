I have my ESTHETA today. 
We watched a movie "WASTE LAND".

WASTE LAND

Waste Land is a 2010 documentary directed by Lucy Walker, João Jardim and Karen Harley. 
The film documents two years of work of Brazilian contemporary modern artist Vik Muniz in creating art with the cooperation of scavengers of recyclables working at Jardim Gramacho, one of the world's largest landfills, serving the metropolis of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
