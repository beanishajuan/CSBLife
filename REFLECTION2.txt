Frosh Solidarity Night

The Frosh Solidarity Night happened on May 20 which is the day after the Frosh Orientation Program. The Frosh Solidarity Night was CSB Life Accredited which means we were required to participate in it.
The first thing that we did was to have a  mass with the Benildean Brother which was heartwarming for all of us. After that a person in the stage shouted and we were all all shocked when members of the audience shouted back.Thus signalling the start of the play. The play was all about two friends, on of them was envious of the other one since she was always a runner up from her friend in every single activity that they do. This activity teaches us that we should accept every trials that we have in life and take them as a challenge. The play was inspirational and caught all of our attention. It opened our eyes in the reality that we should love each other despite of our differences. After the play, the Blazers pep squad performed in front of the students and they taught us the cheers for the NCAA games. They also performed a routine which included stunts and part of the performance was plyaing the drums. I witnessed how the benildean-lasallian students could be so united in one event but there were a lot of negative feedback from the blazers pep squad. The blazers pep squad explained that they didn't do diffucult stunts to avoid accidents. This event goes to show that we can expect a lot more in the days to come. After that, the Bloomfields performed their famous hits. After the Bloomfields performed the dj who caused groups of people to party in the center which was built for dancing.
