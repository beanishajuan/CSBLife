Dear Journal,

It's Wednesday! :D
We're until 1:00pm only :D 

what have I realized this day?
O yeah. I sacrificed my school for her.
Because I should be studying in University of the Philippines in Diliman 
but I didn't because my dad said that we had no money to make my sister study 
anymore so I took the offer that my Coach gave me and also because my mom always get
mad and she pays my tuition fee so if she gets mad and tells that she wouldn't be 
paying for my tuition fee its going to be okay because I have scholarship.
