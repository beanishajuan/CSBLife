Dear Journal,
This is the day when I first made you because Sir Paul Amerigo Pajo Jr. said so.
I have my planner to write what is happening/ has happened to me every single day.
It's a STARBUCKS planner :D I got it because I collected stickers when I drank STARBUCKS when I was in Fourth Year Highschool :D
It is destroyed because the design is not in a good shape already :( I am very careless of my stuff. :(
I slept in the women's athlete room before CSBLife started because I was so tired from the training last night :(
I had my training after classes :D
It was fun and not tiring. :D
That's all folks :D 
See you tomorrow :D
