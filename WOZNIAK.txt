How can I apply Wozniak's System for myself and for the course?

I would be able to apply wozniak's system for myself by learning when to study at the right time and knowing when I should practice my activities so that I would be able to spend all of my time wisely. 
I need to be precise on knowing when I should memorize the step-by-step procedures in programming and the codes needed in programming to maximize my learning output. 
I need to manage my time wisely in order for me to be able to do all of these things.
