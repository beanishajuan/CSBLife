Frosh Orientation Program Reflection

The Frosh Orientation Program happened on the 19th of May year 2011. 
This program helps us to be guided in everything thats going to happen in our stay in De La Salle- College of Saint Benilde and be aware of the school regulations.
For me, the school's policy is balanced of not being stricted nor too light for students to underestimate it. An example is that there is only a maximum of two major offense, incurring three minor offense of different cases means one major offense and five minor offenses of same case means one major offense.
I was shocked that loosing your ID is a one minor offense and that not taking the Drug Test is a Major Offense. 
We were also taught that wearing any open toed shoes such as tong slip style shoe is not allowed and can inccur you a minor offense.
Having a course of Bachelor of Science major in Information Technology specializing in Game Design and Development requires us to wear Business Attire on Monday, Business Casual onn Tuesdays and Causal Attire on Wednesday to Friday.
They also taught us the Alma Mater Hymn of De La Salle University and De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde.
After the orientation we sang the Alma Mater Hymn and they taught us how to express it by using sign language.
They also gave us free food for Merienda and Lunch which show how CSB cares for us.
After we ate, we had another game which was done by block.
