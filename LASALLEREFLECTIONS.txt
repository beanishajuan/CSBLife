"It seems to me, that there is no better way to begin the schools well than to put the teachers who will be there under the protection of one of the parish pastors willing to take them in and to say that he is employing them for the instruction of his people." -St. John Baptist de La Salle 

In my own understanding, St. John Baptist de La Salle wanted to put the teachers under the protection of parish pastors so that the teachers may be guided by God to dutifully fulfil their work. It is somehow symbolical wherein the pastors are used as an instrument of God in helping and guiding the teachers. The teacher’s knowledge alone isn’t sufficient, they must be spiritually guided by the holy spirit so that they may also be able to integrate a Christian learning in the schools. With the help of the pastors, the teachers are also able to teach about God and the church. 

In our society today, we have the government and the church going hand in hand whenever certain issues arises. The government states the way of solving a certain problem while the church states the way of solving a certain problem with a religious and Christian perspective. It is somehow similar to St. John Baptist de La Salle’s quotation wherein we must always have a Christian perspective in doing are tasks, keeping in mind the betterment of our neighbours.
