Sunday

Day with the Lord :D
It's Sunday!

I want go mass but I have a very heavy stomache.
I hate it!
So yeah. I didn't go to mass.
I just stayed in bed so that I wouldn't feel my stomache.
I was so lucky that my friend came and stayed with me until the days ends.
He took care of me when my parent's were busy with household chores.

What have I realized?
I realized to have a friend like my friend because rare people does that today.
